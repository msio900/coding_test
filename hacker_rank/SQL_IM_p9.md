You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the *hacker_id*, *name*, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending *hacker_id*. Exclude all hackers with a total score of from your result.

**Input Format**

The following tables contain contest data:

- *Hackers:* The *hacker_id* is the id of the hacker, and *name* is the name of the hacker. ![img](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19503/1458522826-a9ddd28469-ScreenShot2016-03-21at6.40.27AM.png)
